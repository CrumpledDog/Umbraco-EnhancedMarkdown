# Test Site & Source Code

A test site is included in the solution, the username and password for Umbraco are admin@admin.com/password12345
By default the test site is configured to use full IIS (due to IIS Express SQL CE persistence issue) on the domain enhancedmarkdown.local, you can change it to use IIS Express if you prefer.

Visual Studio 2017 is required for compiling the source code
